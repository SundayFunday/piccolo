**** This code has been slightly modified to control 6 Christmas light outputs. 
Instead of the Piccolo visualizer, I replaced all piccolo code to control Arduino pins 8-13.
I used an Arduino Micro and an Adafruit electrect microphone amplifier. Any standard
250V/10A 8x relay will work.

You can view the finished product on YouTube here. ****
